## 🎯 About This Project

Most automation examples focus on test syntax. This project is different — it demonstrates a **real-world setup** that teams can actually use when starting test automation.

### Why This Template?

- 🏗️ **Production-ready structure** — not just example tests
- 🔧 **Complete infrastructure** — CI/CD, linting, proper configuration
- 📚 **Educational approach** — every decision explained
- 🚀 **Modern stack** — Playwright, TypeScript, GitHub Actions

> **Following along?** This project is built incrementally. Each major feature corresponds to a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ageeva-nadja/) explaining the reasoning behind implementation decisions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 💡 What Makes This Different?

After 7+ years in QA automation, I've noticed most public examples show *how to write tests* but skip *how to structure a real project*. This template fills that gap by demonstrating:

- **Why certain patterns matter** (not just what they are)
- **How to set up maintainable infrastructure** (CI/CD, linting, structure)
- **Real-world trade-offs and decisions** (based on actual experience)
- **Minimum viable setup** that actually works in production

Think of it as **"Create React App" but for test automation**.

### Key Focus Areas

✨ **Architecture** - Scalable structure that grows with your project  
✨ **Automation** - CI/CD from day one, not as an afterthought  
✨ **Quality** - Linting and best practices built in  
✨ **Education** - Every decision explained with reasoning
